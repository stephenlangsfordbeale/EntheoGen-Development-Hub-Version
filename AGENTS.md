## Repo Guidance

Work directly when the task is clear, bounded, and low-risk. Keep diffs small,
reviewable, and reversible, and prefer the repository's existing patterns over
new abstractions.

Do not commit secrets, tokens, private keys, or live credentials. Use placeholder
values in examples and documentation.

Do not revert user or branch changes unless explicitly asked. If unrelated
changes are present, leave them alone; if they affect the task, work with them
and call out any remaining risk.

Dependencies may be added when they are needed for requested work,
verification, or existing tooling. Keep additions narrow and explain why they
are needed.

Technical checks must verify that the code, data, build, or runtime behavior
works. Do not make technical checks depend on project-management or process
ceremony such as Linear issue references, PR-template wording, branch names,
provenance fields, checklist completion, agent/delegate identity, or
documentation anchors. Those details may be recorded as optional traceability
metadata, but their presence or absence must never block local work, tests, CI,
PR creation, merge review, workflow use, or repository operation unless the user
explicitly asks for that enforcement.

Use `guard`, `gate`, `enforce`, `required`, and `must` only for technical
invariants or explicit human instructions. For process metadata, prefer
`record`, `note`, `document`, `suggest`, or `prefer`.

Broad refactors should be protected with tests before behavior-changing edits.
Small obvious fixes, documentation edits, and simple tooling updates may be made
directly.

Commit messages should explain why the change was made. Structured trailers are
not required.

## Verification

Forbidden verification: do not add tests, scripts, CI checks, package commands,
or build steps that assert project-management ceremony. Tests may verify product
behavior, data validity, schemas, runtime contracts, type safety, build output,
and executable workflow logic. Tests must not verify Linear references,
PR-template wording, branch names, checklist completion, provenance fields,
issue labels, agent identity, or documentation anchors.

Before adding any test, script, CI check, or package command, confirm:

- It proves runtime, code, data, schema, build, or executable workflow behavior.
- It cannot fail because optional process metadata is missing or worded
  differently.
- It cannot block useful work that otherwise functions.

If any check would fail because of project-management ceremony, do not add it.

Use the real commands available in this repo:

- `npm run typecheck` for TypeScript verification.
- `npm run build` for production build verification.
- `npm test` for the knowledge-base and interaction validation suite.
- `npm run ci:checks` for the full PR-aligned gate (typecheck, validators,
  submission-intake, alignment suite, build); see
  `docs/automation/QUALITY_AND_RELIABILITY.md`.
- Targeted scripts such as `npm run test:slack`, `npm run kb:validate`, or
  `npm run validate:interactions:v2` when they directly cover the change.

Run the checks that are directly relevant to the files changed. Do not invent
fake verification.

## OMX Runtime

Use direct execution for routine, bounded repo work.

Use OMX runtime workflows such as `ralph`, `ralplan`, `team`, or `ultrawork`
only when the user explicitly asks for them, or when the task is large,
ambiguous, multi-agent, or needs durable staged coordination.

Do not require PRDs, test-spec gates, team overlays, or runtime state updates
for small fixes, documentation edits, simple scripts, dependency/tooling fixes,
or ordinary verification.

## Automation Components

For EntheoGen automation components, follow
`docs/automation/AUTOMATION_AGENTS.md`. That specification defines the live
automation role boundaries, output contracts, and human-approval constraints.
Agent package locations, safety contracts, and verifier commands are summarized
in `docs/automation/AGENT_AND_SAFETY_OUTPUTS.md`.

For **Linear-first tone and submission boundaries** versus repo Markdown, see
`AUTOMATION_README.md` (*Documentation direction*).
Automation may use scoped approved tools such as Azure, Supabase,
Cloudflare/Wrangler, Slack, GitHub, Linear, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and other
approved local or hosted tools when they support the requested work and preserve
human approval boundaries.

## Learned User Preferences

- Prefer minimal, isolated patches over broad refactors.
- Keep provenance/auth systems untouched during interaction UI/data-layer work
  unless explicitly requested.
- Remove dead code only when TypeScript explicitly confirms it is unused.
- Keep new filtering logic centralized in a single composable helper.
- Use normalized `UIInteraction` fields for UI behavior and rendering instead of
  raw dataset fields.
- Keep retained memory artifacts and Slack channel record artifacts local-only
  (gitignored), not committed; when `.env` gains new local-only keys or paths,
  extend `.gitignore` so those additions are not committed.
- Treat legacy `interactions_enriched` CSV exports as reference-only, not
  canonical against the live `interactions` table.
- When normalizing Phase 1 imports or split migrations, map short codes and
  `UNK` into existing `INFERRED`/`THEORETICAL` conventions instead of ad hoc
  enum values.
- After live Supabase Phase 1 edits, refresh CSVs from the base tables: exports
  are typically named **`interactions_rows.csv`** and **`substances_rows.csv`**.
  Align them into workspace-root **`interactions.csv`** and **`substances.csv`**
  (same columns the build expects), then run `npm run dataset:build-beta -- .`
  so branch snapshots match production before relying on them. When swapping
  bulk rows through the Supabase SQL Editor only (no local `psql`), prefer a
  staging table plus `INSERT … SELECT` matched to the live table’s exact column
  list over ad hoc or CLI-only import paths.
- Remove throwaway one-off CSV or dataset patch scripts after a successful run
  instead of leaving them in the repo.
- Comments posted through Cursor’s Linear integration appear as the
  authenticated Linear user (OAuth); expect that attribution unless a separate
  automation identity is wired.
- When the user attaches an implementation plan with todos already created, do
  not edit the plan file itself; mark existing todos in progress instead of
  recreating them.
- Metabase / Phase 1 dashboards: exclude **self-pairs** from analysis by default
  (**`is_comparable_pair = true`** on `interactions_enriched`; self rows remain
  in the model); use
  **`risk_score` on a 1–5 numeric axis**, not 0–1;
  show **NULL as “N/A”** where easy; use **natural UI labels** on most charts
  when straightforward; prefer **best use of the current dataset** without
  blocking on sign-off for routine exclusions or display conventions (see
  `docs/metabase/README.md`). When validating exports or saved questions against
  `interactions_enriched.sql`, map **normalized** `substance_1_id` /
  `substance_2_id` (LEAST/GREATEST order), not raw `substance_a` / `substance_b`
  row order, and keep **`risk_bucket`** consistent with that SQL/README cutoffs
  (or rename divergent calculated tiers so they are not confused with
  `risk_score`).

## Learned Workspace Facts

- The UI interaction adapter is centered in `src/data/uiInteractions.ts`.
- Research Mode filtering is centralized in `src/data/researchMode.ts`.
- A dev regression assertion script exists at
  `scripts/testUIInteractionsAdapter.ts`.
- Continual-learning state is tracked locally via
  `.cursor/hooks/state/continual-learning-index.json`.
- Private student beta launch runbooks and cross-tool alignment notes live under
  `docs/private-student-beta/` (environments, GitLab guardrails, Linear/Jira
  sync, workflow links).
- Supabase Phase 1 exposes `interactions` and `substances` base tables; canonical
  pair analytics SQL is **`public.interactions_enriched`** (see
  `docs/metabase/interactions_enriched.sql` and
  `supabase/migrations/*_public_interactions_enriched_view.sql`). Some environments
  may still use `public.analytics_interactions_v2` until Phase 2 migrations add
  `interaction_pairs_v2` and related normalized tables.
- Multi-mechanism Metabase questions should explode `mechanism_categories` with
  `jsonb_array_elements_text` in native SQL.
- Dataset Beta Docker Compose runs Metabase as `metabase_local` with Postgres
  `metabase_metadata_db`; use `docker compose -f` pointed at that repo when not
  in its working directory. If `docker compose up` fails because the metadata
  container name is already in use, remove or rename the conflicting container
  before starting the stack again. In EntheoGen, `docs/metabase` is model SQL
  and README only (no Compose stack there); live analytics use a Metabase
  database connection to Supabase Phase 1, and local `interactions.csv` truth
  reaches Metabase through the Phase 1 CSV pipeline, not by dropping CSVs into
  `docs/metabase`. When replacing **`public.interactions_enriched`** in Postgres,
  **`CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW`** cannot change existing column names or order
  (**`42P16`**); use **`DROP VIEW … CASCADE`** then **`CREATE VIEW`** (as in the
  repo migration) or keep the prior signature identical.
- `npm run dataset:build-beta -- .` reads workspace-root **`interactions.csv`**
  and **`substances.csv`** (not the Supabase default export names
  `interactions_rows.csv` / `substances_rows.csv` unless renamed or copied) and
  rebuilds `src/data/substances_snapshot.json` and
  `src/exports/interaction_pairs.json`; the export’s per-pair mechanism field
  reflects **`primary_mechanism_category`**, while CSV **`mechanism_categories`**
  arrays can be richer for downstream and Metabase until exports mirror them.
- Legacy aggregate substance id `mdma_2cx_dox_nbome` decomposes to `mdma`,
  `two_c_x`, `dox`, and `nbome_series` in aggregate decomposition maps.
- Phase 1 `public.interactions`: `classification_confidence` is **text** tiers
  (`low`/`medium`/`high`/etc.), **`risk_score`** is an integer scale (typically
  **1–5** plus null/`is_self_pair` quirks), not 0–1 probabilities—for ad hoc SQL
  and Metabase, bucket and cast accordingly; joined substance labels must attach
  to **`LEAST`/`GREATEST`**-sorted IDs when canonicalizing `(a,b)` order.
- `npm run test:suite:alignment` includes `npm run test:ui-adapter` as part of
  the alignment suite leveraged by `ci:checks`; Cursor Cloud Agent base images
  for this repo are defined under `.cursor/` (`environment.json` and
  `Dockerfile`); private repos listed in `environment.json`
  **`repositoryDependencies`** must be cloneable by the GitHub account linked to
  Cloud Agent or remote agent provisioning may fail.
