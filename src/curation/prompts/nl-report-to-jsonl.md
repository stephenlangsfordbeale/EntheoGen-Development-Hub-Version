# Natural Language Report to Interaction Update Proposal

Purpose: convert one natural-language pharmacology or harm-reduction report into
one reviewable `InteractionUpdateProposal` JSONL line.

`src/curation/interaction-updates.jsonl`

This prompt proposes structured data only. It does not approve, apply, publish,
or reinterpret the report beyond the evidence it provides.

## Scope

Use this prompt for reports that identify a substance pair, mechanism, risk
interpretation, and supporting source context. Output is suitable for PR review
and later human approval before any dataset change.

Automation may:
- Normalize the pair into existing dataset substance IDs when they are clear.
- Convert report text into the JSON shape below.
- Preserve uncertainty and source gaps explicitly.

Humans must approve:
- Whether the proposal should be applied.
- Any classification, confidence, evidence tier, or practical guidance change.
- Whether source references are sufficient for publication-facing data.

Do not:
- Invent source IDs, quotes, locators, or direct evidence.
- Upgrade confidence because the report is persuasive.
- Mark an update as approved or applied.

## Output rules

- Output exactly one JSON object.
- No markdown fence.
- No commentary.
- Must be valid single-line JSONL.
- Do not approve or apply the update.
- Always set `"status": "proposed"`.
- Use existing pair IDs/substance IDs from the dataset when available.
- If no structured source IDs exist, use `"source_gap"`.
- Preserve uncertainty conservatively.
- Keep output explicitly draft/reviewable and never frame it as final authority.
- Use `reviewer_notes` with explicit section labels in this order:
  `Extracted: ... Inferred: ... Uncertainty: ... Draft-only: ...`
  so extracted facts, inferred suggestions, and uncertainty remain separated.
- Use current dataset-facing summary fields: `clinical_summary.headline`,
  `clinical_summary.mechanism`, `clinical_summary.timing_guidance`, and
  `clinical_summary.field_notes`.
- Put reviewer-facing action posture, monitoring, and practical cautions in
  `clinical_summary.field_notes`; do not emit the stale
  `clinical_summary.practical_guidance` key.

## Classification mapping

- green / low → LOW
- amber / caution / moderate → CAUTION
- unsafe / high risk → UNSAFE
- red / dangerous / contraindicated → DANGEROUS
- unknown / insufficient data → UNKNOWN

## Confidence rules

- Use `"high"` only with direct evidence or strong guideline support.
- Use `"medium"` for plausible, well-supported mechanistic or clinical-practice claims.
- Use `"low"` for sparse, speculative, or source-gap-only claims.
- If direct data are limited, cap confidence at `"medium"`.
- If the report depends on unverified synthesis or field observation only, cap
  confidence at `"low"` unless a human reviewer later adds stronger sources.

## Mechanism category rules

Use only valid v2.1 categories:
- serotonergic_toxicity
- maoi_potentiation
- psychedelic_intensification
- sympathomimetic_load
- cardiovascular_load
- qt_or_arrhythmia_risk
- cns_depression
- respiratory_depression
- seizure_threshold
- anticholinergic_delirium
- dopaminergic_load
- glutamatergic_dissociation
- gabaergic_modulation
- dehydration_or_electrolyte_risk
- psychiatric_destabilization
- operational_or_behavioral_risk
- unknown

## Acceptance criteria

- The output parses as one JSON object on one line.
- `status` is `"proposed"`.
- The pair uses known substance IDs where possible, or reviewer notes explain the
  unresolved mapping.
- Every missing or weak source link is visible in `source_refs` or
  `reviewer_notes`.
- No field claims that human review has already approved, applied, or published
  the change.

## Verification

After adding generated output to `src/curation/interaction-updates.jsonl`, run:

```sh
npm run updates:test-parser
npm run validate:interactions:v2
```

Expected output: parser and interaction validation commands exit successfully.

Known limitation: this prompt structures a proposal; it cannot establish clinical
truth, source adequacy, or publication readiness without reviewer approval.
